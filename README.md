Forestry Localizations
======================

Localizations for Forestry

### en_US

The en_US localization is not part of this repository but instead part of the main code. Do not add a en_US.properties file.

### Encoding

Files must be encoded in ISO 8859-1. UTF-8 will not work. Pull requests, submissions or contributions not encoded in ISO 8859-1 will have to be rejected or reverted.

### Testing your language files

Put the files into your .minecraft directory into a subfolder "lang/" that mirrors that of the Forestry jar. Any correctly named localization file should take precedence over the defaults in the jar.

Alternatively you can also add your localization files to the Forestry .jar directly. The "lang/"-folder in it is not signed, so modifying it is safe.
